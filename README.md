# token_svg

A webpage to make generic round tokens (100px x 100px PNG files) for use on [owlbear rodeo](http://owlbear.app) or any other VTT or purpose, but I made it to support my need for quick off the cuff tokens that could be made visually distinct for owlbear.  

The generic tokens have a fill color (the center), ring color and text color.  The text can be 0-2 characters, so it can still be read.  The ring can be from 0px to completely filling the token.

All values can be randomly and manually set.
